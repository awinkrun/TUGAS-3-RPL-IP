ANALISIS LAYANAN

This code takes in the inputs of computer_amount, in_business_hours, and drop_off_pick_up using the input() function in Python. It uses a series of if statements to determine the base_fee and additional_fee. It then prompts the user to enter the number of peripherals and multiplies the additional_fee by the number of peripherals. Finally, it applies any discounts or surcharges and calculates the total_fee, which it outputs to the console using formatted string literals (f-strings).
